![UI-Stronghold-Roster-Add-On](!info/display_01.jpg "NgGH-Magic-Origins-Mod repo: Have a better experience when using stronghold roster system")

## Description
Stronghold is a great mod but one thing has been bugging me. It's the way you store/retrieve brother from stronghold, i'm not a fan of that text based UI so i made this mod to improve your experience using stronghold roster.

Here is what you can expect to see with the new UI:
1. Easier to store/retrieve brother from stronghold roster
2. Allow you to rename any brother
3. Dismiss brother in stronghold roster
4. Checking perk tree of selected brother
5. Visible stats/talents/skills of selected brother
6. Stripping arms, armors, bag items or all equipment from selected brother
7. Allow you to store up to 165 brothers in stronghold

# Note:
This mod is originally made for Stronghold mod with Legends mod installed, which is the recommend set up. I haven't tested it with no Legends mod installed game, i can forsee this mod can create a exploit allows vanilla game to have more brothers in battle than the limit.
